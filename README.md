# learnml

Repository for  machine learning practice. Contains different types of machine learning models (regression, classification, clustering, neural nets, etc.) and datasets/links to datasets that can be used for practice. These were created as I reviewed & relearned ml models using modern ml libraries. I hope they can be useful for somebody else learning / relearning ml. Feel free to contribute :)

## Getting Started

Most of the code is implemented as Jupyter Notebooks, so you're going to need to have that installed in your python build. You'll also have to install most of the frequently used python libraries to support ML such as numpy, scipy, pandas, scikit-learn, tensorflow.
